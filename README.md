# JSP Project Readme

This project includes several steps for running JSP files. Follow the instructions below to run the project successfully.

## Exercise Steps

### Step 1: Create a Database
- Set up the required database for the project. Ensure that the database is accessible and correctly configured.

### Step 2: Check `hibernate.cfg.xml` Configuration
- Open the `hibernate.cfg.xml` file and verify that the configuration details are accurate. Check for the following information:
  - Database connection URL, username, and password.
  - Mapping details for the entities.
  - Other Hibernate configurations specific to the project's requirements.

### Step 3: Run the Test Class
- Navigate to the `ma.projet.test` package.
- Run the `Test.java` class within the package. Confirm that all necessary dependencies are available and that the classpath is appropriately configured.

### Step 4: Running JSP Files
- For the session project, execute the `auth.jsp` file. You should be redirected to this link: [http://localhost:33631/session/auth.jsp](http://localhost:33631/session/auth.jsp).
- For the orders management project, run the `Produit.jsp` file. You should be redirected to: [http://localhost:33631/web2vf/Produit.jsp](http://localhost:33631/web2vf/Produit.jsp).

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that all required libraries and dependencies are added to the project.
- Double-check that the database connection details in the configuration file are accurate and match the configured database.
- Keep an eye on the console or logs for any error messages during the process.
